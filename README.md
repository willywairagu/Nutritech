## Improved Non-invasive Glucometer alongside a data Logging application to improve on Diabetes Monitoring
Background
Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose and released into your bloodstream, when this glucose levels go up, it signals the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.
Recent studies have indicated that the health risks associated with diabetes are significantly reduced when the blood glucose level are well and frequently controlled.
Therefore, having proper monitoring at home or work is important. The commonly used method of measuring glucose levels is by the use of invasive glucometers that require obtaining blood samples by pricking a fingertip with a needle. 

This concept note proposes a non-invasive method where the patient only places his/her fingers on a measuring point on top of a portable glucometer rather than using injections.
This Glucometer is an IoT based device in the sense that these readings are sent to the patient’s handset where one is to fill in some additional information regarding their nutritional uptake for the day. With the help of an embedded machine learning algorithm, patterns can be detected from this data points and recommendations(inference) given regarding what nutritional elements the patient should uptake the following day for an optimal glucose level to be maintained.
